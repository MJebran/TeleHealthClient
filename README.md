# Project Overview

## 1. Elevator Pitch

"My project is a healthcare web application designed to connect patients and doctors. Patients can log in to upload details about their symptoms and health issues, while doctors can review the cases and provide treatment suggestions."

## 2. List of Features

- **User Roles and Permissions**:
  - **Patient Role**: Allows patients to register, log in, and upload details about their health concerns.
  - **Doctor Role**: Enables doctors to log in, view patient cases, and provide treatment suggestions.

- **Case Management**:
  - **Create Case**: Patients can create and submit new cases detailing their symptoms and medical history.
  - **View Cases**:
    - **Patients**: Can view their submitted cases and see responses from doctors.
    - **Doctors**: Can access all open cases to review and respond.
  - **Respond to Cases**: Doctors can provide treatment advice and mark cases as resolved if needed.

- **File Upload for Reports**:
  - Allow patients to upload images or PDF reports related to their condition (e.g., lab results, X-rays).

- **Search and Filter Cases**:
  - Search and filter cases based on criteria like date, severity, or specific symptoms.

- **Dashboard**:
  - **Patients**: View a summary of their health cases and responses.
  - **Doctors**: See an overview of pending and resolved cases.

- **Detailed Case View**:
  - A page where each case's full details, patient-uploaded files, and doctor responses are displayed.

- **Responsive Design**:
  - Ensure the app is optimized for mobile and desktop, with intuitive navigation and a user-friendly interface.

- **Data Persistence**:
  - Save user sessions and preferences for easy access to case history and interactions.

- **API Endpoints**:
  - **Get all cases**: Retrieve a list of all cases (accessible by doctors).
  - **Get a case by ID**: Fetch details of a specific case.
  - **Post new case**: Allow patients to create a new case.
  - **Update case status**: Enable doctors to update a caseâ€™s status.
  - **File Upload Endpoint**: Allow patients to upload files related to their case.
  - **Doctor Response Endpoint**: Allow doctors to submit responses to cases.

> **Note**: For now, the **Messaging System** and **Notification System** features will not be implemented.

## 3. New Tasks for Project Completion

- **Design Patient and Doctor Dashboards**:
  - Create customized views for patients to monitor their cases and for doctors to manage cases efficiently.

- **Implement Case Submission and Response System**:
  - Build the infrastructure for patients to submit cases and for doctors to respond with treatment suggestions.

- **Set Up File Upload and Management**:
  - Develop functionality for patients to upload medical files, ensuring secure storage and easy access for doctors.

- **Add Search and Filter Options**:
  - Allow doctors to search and filter cases to manage workload and prioritize responses.

- **Develop a Responsive and Accessible UI**:
  - Optimize the user interface for accessibility and ensure it is responsive across various devices.

- **Build API Endpoints for Case Management**:
  - Set up API endpoints to handle all case-related operations, including retrieving cases, updating statuses, and uploading files.

- **Test and Secure the Application**:
  - Conduct thorough testing for usability and performance, and implement security best practices to protect patient data.
> **Note**: For now, the **Test and Secure the Application** feature will not be implemented.

- **CI/CD and Deployment**:
